Prosethic Hand

This is the code for my proesthic hand capstone project. The project uses two different arduinos and they are communicating with two different HC-05 modules. One arduino is connected to a glove which has flex sensors attached to each finger and the data from that is then sent to the other arduino. The arduino that recieves the data then controls the servo motors and is located in the prosethic hand. This process is through bluetooth and wireless. Below is a schematic of the wiring (some stuff are changed on final prototype, if curious message me on how to set this up). Below that are images of our final design.
